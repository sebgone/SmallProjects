# Monostable Multivibrator

## Theory:
Monostable multivibrator is used in electronic timing applications. It have only one stable state and produce a single output pulse when it is triggered externally. Monostable Multivibrators only return back to their first original and stable state after a period of time determined by the time constant of the RC coupled circuit

## Application:
The circuit can be used to generate specific length of square wave impulse. It is triggered by pressing tactile switch. 

## Specification: 
- *Vcc - 9 [V]*
- *High state time - 7 [s]*
