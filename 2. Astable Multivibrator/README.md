# Astable Multivibrator

## Theory:
Astable multivibrator is an oscillator circuit which oscillates between to states continually producing two square wave output wavefoms. It is the the most commonly used type of relaxation oscillator. Parameters of this transisor switching circuit are regulated by specific  resistors and capacitors values. That enable to change the pulse width and frequency of the signal.    

## Application:
The circuit can be used to continously switch output state. For example generated wave can falsh lights or produce sound. 

## Specification: 
- *Vcc - 9 [V]*
- *f - 1 [Hz]*
- *T - 1 [s]*
- *pulse width - 50%*
