# Bistable Multivibrator

## Theory:
Bistable multivibrator is a circuit which has two states.  It can be flipped from one state to the other by an external trigger pulse. In this case trigger pulse is served by a tactile switch. First switch set the signal and the second switch reset it. Output state is represented by led diode. 

## Application:
The circuit can be used to trigger on/off pulse to any device by two monostable tactile switch. 

## Specification: 
*Vcc - 9 V*
