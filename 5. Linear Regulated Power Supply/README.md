# Linear Regulated Power Supply

## Theory:
Linear regulated power supplies gain their name from the fact that they use linear, i.e. non-switching techniques to regulate the voltage output from the power supply. The term linear power supply implies that the power supply is regulated to provide the correct voltage at the output.

## Aplication:
Supply electronics devices with stable voltage.

## Specification:
- *Max regulated voltage - 12 [V]*
- *Max load current - 0,650 [A]*
- *Operating mode - 5 V, 9 V, 12 V, 2-12 V*
