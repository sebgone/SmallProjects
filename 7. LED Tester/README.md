# LED Tester

## Application:
Led tester is a device which helps with monitoring and measuring semiconductor diodes. Circuit is based on emitter current source. System force exact amount of current so the voltge drop on diode depend on diode chracteristic. Current source can be set with range 0 - 25 mA. There are measuring points to measure voltage and current by external multimeter. 

## specificaton:
- *Vcc 9 V / 12 V set by jumper*
- *Current source 5 mA, 10 mA 15 mA, regulated 0-25 mA, set by jumper*
- *Voltage measure connenction*
- *current measure connection set by slide switch*
